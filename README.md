# MLX90640 OPC UA Thermal Server and Thermal Client-Viewer

This project sets up an **OPC UA server** to stream thermal data from an **MLX90640 infrared camera** over IÂ²C and a **OPC UA client**, a thermal viewer written in python QML and opencv, to display the thermal data. 
We use a BeagleBone black to connect the MLX90640 and run the server.
